Topic: Exploring Philadelphia bike share system's usage pattern & imbalance pressure

Slide 1: Indego intro + project intro
    Map: Philadelphia bike share system's station locations (in different sizes based on station size)
    Sidebar: Philadelphia bike share system (Indego) Intro: # of station, bikes, docks
             Two graphs showing temporal usage pattern during weekdays and weekends
             Explain system imbalance pressure: (# of return - # of checkout) / station size

Slide 2: Weekday usage pattern
    Map: Display 3 temporal clusters of indego (stations are colored based on cluster group)
    Sidebar: Explain the method of identifying clusters

Slide 3 ~5: Weekday usage pattern - cluster 1 ~ cluster 3
    Map: Display cluster 1 ~ 3 respectively (change the zoom level)
    Sidebar: Explain imbalance pressure time series graph
             Describe neighborhood characteristics of each cluster

Slide 6: Weekend usage pattern
    Map: Display 3 temporal clusters of indego (stations are colored based on cluster group)
    Sideebar:

Slide 7~9: Weekend usage pattern - cluster 1 ~ cluster 3
    Map: Display cluster 1 ~ 3 respectively (change the zoom level)
    Sidebar: Explain imbalance pressure time series graph
             Describe neighborhood characteristics of each cluster

Slide 10: Weekday total activity pattern

Slide 11: Weekend total activity pattern

Slide 12: Final group - weekday

Slide 13: Final group - weekend

Slide 14~15: The most active & the least active stations (weekday & weekend)
    Map: Location of the most active & the least active stations
    Sidebar: Explain how active is defined: # of return + # of checkout
             Describe how imbalance are these two stations

Slide 16: The most imbalanced day and time for each station

Slide 17: When does the highest imbalance pressure happen? Where?
    Map: Location of the most imbalance stations during peak hours
    Sidebar: Showing time series graphs of these two stations

Slide 18: Conclusion
    Map: go back to the fisrt map
