      <h1>Philadelphia Bikeshare Usage Pattern</h1>
      <p>
        Philadelphia's bike share system, Indego, has gained wide popularity in the city.
        First launched in April 2015, the accumulated ridership has exceeded 400,000 in less than a year.
        The trip data have been made available on <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/indego-bike-share-trips">OpenDataPhilly</a> and <a href="https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/">Indeogo's official website</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This story map explores the pattern of temporal imbalance pressure and total activities for every Indego station.
        Trip records during the first three months are excluded to produce more reliable results.
        Through this story map, we can understand the trip pattern on weekdays and weekends, and evaluate whether existed station sizes meet user demands.

      <h1>Weekday Usage Pattern</h1>
      <p>
        Imbalance pressure reflects how well the number of checkout and return can balance each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, we define imbalance pressure as: (Number of Return - Number of Checkout) / Station size
      </p>
      <p>
        We summarize trip records of each station by a time stamp of 1 hour for every weekday from July 1st to December 31st.
        Then, for every hour, we calculate the average number of checkout, return, and imbalance pressure.
        This leads to 120 time series values of weekday checkout/return/imbalance pressure and 48 values on weekends for every station.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using k-means clustering method, we identified 3 weekday temporal clusters based on the value of imbalance pressure.

      <h1>Average Weekday Activities</h1>
      <p>
        The average total number of check out and return reflects how active a station is.
        Notice that we did not divide the total activities by station size here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using k-means clustering method, we grouped all stations from highly used to lowly used.

    </div>

    <div id="eleventh_slide" style="display: none;">
      <h1>Average Weekend Activities</h1>
      <p>
        Again, we grouped all stations from highly used to lowly used based on average weekend activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        By comparing weekday and weekend activity maps, we can spot several noticeable changes.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Philadelphia Museum of Art station belongs to the "lowly used" group on weekdays but belongs to "highly used" group on weekends.
          </li>
          <li>
            Total activity at the Amtrak 30th Street station is lower during weekends.
          </li>
          <li>
            Total activity at the 18th & JFK station is also lower during weekends.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="graph_index"> Graph 11: Average weekend activities<br /><em>Click on stations to see detail number of station activities</em></p>
    </div>

    <div id="twelfth_slide" style="display: none;">
      <h1>Combine Weekday Usage Pattern & Weekday Average Activities</h1>
      <p>
        Combining usage pattern and average activities information together,
        we can see what types of temporal imbalance pressure each station belongs to,
        and whether it is highly used or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        An ideal usage pattern of bike share system is that number of checkout and return can balance each other at every station.
        However, this is often not the case since people can borrow/return at different stations, and since some places are major trip destinations and some others are major trip origins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maintain appropriate occupancy rate to relieve the imbalance pressure is therefore very important, especially for those stations that are highly used and face high imbalance pressure during peak hours.
        For this type of stations, another way is to expand the station size so that more bikes or docks and be reserved.
